# üîÑ htswap

**Minimal, lightweight script for seamless AJAX-style UI content swapping.** By importing `htswap`, and adding a `data-htswap` attribute, your anchors and forms get the speed of client-side-rendering in your server-side-rendered/static sites.

Based on **Swap.js**, and inspired by **HTMZ**, **HTMX**, **Alpine-Ajax**, among others. A modern, smaller, more semantic alternative.

> [!WARNING]  
> Expect breaking changes until v1.

## ‚ú¥Ô∏èÔ∏è Features

- **Dynamic Content**: Content on the page will be swapped dynamically, without reloading
- **History Support**: Browser back/forward buttons will work seamlessly, without reloading  
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Anchors and forms can be opted in by a single attribute
- **Loading States**: Loading state can be styled through `aria-busy="true"`
- **Graceful Degradation**: If JS is turned off, your anchors and forms will work as normal

## üì¶ Installation

There are several build/distribution variants: 

- `dist`: modern and default (es2020)
- `dist-compat`: compatible with older browsers (es2015)
- `dist-min`: same as `dist` but minified
- `dist-min-compat`: same as `dist-compat` but minified

Any of the variants can be installed through the following methods:

- Import from a CDN, changing the `dist` part to any of the variants:

```html
<script type="module" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/htswap@latest/dist/htswap.js"></script>
```

- Download a copy of the script file into your codebase from [any of the dist directories here](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/htswap/).

- Install with a package manager and import any of the variants on the client side: `pnpm i htswap`

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

After making sure `htswap` is imported, the `data-htswap` attribute can be on any element to let its children work with `htswap` automatically.

The attribute can be added on the `body` element to enable `htswap` on all the links and anchors in the site.

### Anchors

Anchors automatically replace the whole page, replicating client-side behaviour. The `href` will determine which page to fetch for swapping.

```html
<!-- on home page (/) -->
<nav data-htswap>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<a href="/account">Account</a>
		</li>
	</ul>
</nav>
```

They can be further enhanced by adding `data-htswap` on them and giving it a target, determining which element to swap dynamically, rather than using the whole page.

```html
<!-- on dashboard users page (/dashboard/users) -->
<div>
	<aside>
		<a href="/dashboard/users" data-htswap="#dashboard-content">Users</a>
		<a href="/dashboard/products" data-htswap="#dashboard-content">Products</a>
	</aside>
	<main id="dashboard-content">
		<!-- Content gets swapped here -->
	</main>
</div>
```

Note that the parent element having `data-htswap` is not necessary anymore as the elements themselves have it.

All swapping operations work with **browser history**, and navigating backward will swap back to the previous content, without a reload.

### Forms 

Forms are also automatically enhanced and support targetting. And they will add their inputs as URL or body params when swapping, allowing the server to take actions according to the current state of the form.

```html
<!-- on search page (/products) -->
<div>
	<form action="/products" data-htswap="#list" method="get">
		<input type="text" name="product-name" id="product-name" placeholder="Search products...">
		<button type="submit">Search</button>
	</form>
	<ul id="list">
		<li>PC Gaming Controller</li>
		<li>24 Inch Monitor</li>
		<li>Gaming Chair</li>
	</ul>
</div>
```

### Multiple Targets

Multiple targets can be specified by separating them with a comma, with full support for query selectors.

```html
<div>
	<nav>
		<h2 id="nav-username">
			Example Name
		</h2>
	</nav>

	<h2 id="page-username">
		Example Name
	</h2>

	<a href="/get-username" data-htswap="#page-username, #nav-username">Search</a>
</div>	
```

### History

Several modes of interacting with history are supported, with `push` being the default.

- `push`: changes the URL but the user can navigate back to the previous URL. 
- `replace`: changes the URL but the user can't navigate back. 
- `none`: doesn't change the URL.

```html
<div>
	<a href="/search" data-htswap="#list" data-hthistory="replace">Search</a>
</div>
```

### Merge Modes

The `data-htswap` attribute can include specific merge modes, using the `@` symbol, to determine how the content is inserted into the target.

```html
<div>
	<a href="/search" data-htswap="#list@afterend">Search</a>
	<ul id="list">
		<li>P1</li>
		<li>P2</li>
		<li>P3</li>
	</ul>
</div>
```

The following modes are available:

- `outerHTML`: The default mode, which replaces the entire target element with the new content.
- `innerHTML`: Replaces the inner content of the target element with the new content.
- `afterbegin`: Inserts the new content inside the target element, as the first child.
- `afterend`: Inserts the new content inside the target element, as the last child.
- `beforebegin`: Inserts the new content as sibling of the target element, before it.
- `beforeend`: Inserts the new content as sibling of the target element, after it.

### Target Aliases

The `->` symbol can be used to specify an alias for the target element, which will be used on the response document, and mapped to the target element on the client side.

```html
<div>
	<a href="/search" data-htswap="#search-results->#list">Search</a>
	<ul id="list">
		<li>P1</li>
		<li>P2</li>
		<li>P3</li>
	</ul>
</div>
```

### More

#### Locking

Individual elements under `data-htswap` can be opted out of swapping, using `data-htlocked`.

```html
<div>
	<a href="/content" data-htswap="#content" data-htlocked>Iframe</a>
</div>
```

#### No Script

It is recommended for the backend to check the `x-htswap` header, and only return partial content if it's present, otherwise return the full page to avoid users who have js disabled from seeing partial content as a page.

## ‚ùì Why? 

With this section being personal reasoning, I'll first go through similar libraries/scripts, detailing what I don't like about them:

- [`Swap.js`](https://github.com/josephernest/Swap.js): 450b gzipped, no form support, no history or merge modes, old codebase.
- [`Alpine-AJAX`](https://alpine-ajax.js.org/): 3kb gzipped, requires `alpinejs` to work.
- [`HTMZ`](https://leanrada.com/htmz/): 160b gzipped, noticeable 1-2 second delay on the first click, no history or merge modes, elements don't work when js is turned off. 
- [`HTMX`](https://htmx.org/): 11kb gzipped, too large, too flexible and verbose, decides that other elements (e.g. buttons, divs) should make ajax requests.
- [`zjax`](https://www.zjax.dev/): 5kb gzipped, includes client-side interactivity logic, disregards built-in anchor/form logic.
- [`data-star`](https://data-star.dev/): 10kb gzipped, too large, covers too much ground, includes client-side interactivity logic, disregards built-in anchor/form logic, needs backend integration (potentially outdated point).

Your usecase or preference might align with one of the above, but I needed `htswap`, which:

- Doesn't hit 999b (gzipped) in size.
- Doesn't include anything more than enhancements for anchors/forms.
- Doesn't break existing anchor/form functionality.
- Doesn't force you to use its aproach for client-side interactivity.
- Doesn't require site users to use JS.
- Doesn't need any other library to work.
- Doesn't care about the backend tech.

This is obviously subject to change as `htswap` reaches v1. More can be integrated from the great alternatives mentioned above.
